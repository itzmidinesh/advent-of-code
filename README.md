These instructions will help you run the code in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to install the following on your computer.

### Running Code

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itzmidinesh/advent-of-code.git
    ```
2. Run `cd advent-of-code` to change the working directory.
3. Place the input data from [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) into the file `input.txt`.
4. Run the following in your terminal or command prompt to run the script. 
    ```python

    ```
    Note: Replace xx with the day of the challenge you are trying to solve. i.e., 01, 02, etc.
5. The solution for both parts of the challenge for the day would be printed in the terminal.

### Screenshots
Here is an example screenshot of how to run the script in the terminal/command prompt.
